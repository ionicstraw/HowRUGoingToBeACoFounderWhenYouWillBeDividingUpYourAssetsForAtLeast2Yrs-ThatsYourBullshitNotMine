# HowRUGoingToBeACoFounderWhenYouWillBeDividingUpYourAssetsForAtLeast2Yrs-ThatsYourBullshitNotMine

its actually not a good idea for me to interact with ur github bc my github profile picture will show up next to yours in a google search

ure going to be googled and surveiled daily for those atleast 2 yrs by friends and lawyers for any mistake they can get on u

who is going to fk you like me, so u learned that the hard way, what a chaotic mess ure in

im going to also be googled and surveiled daily for those 2+ yrs, by ppl ive never met before in brooklyn of all places, theyre going to want to put two and two together, and they prolly will

my advice to u is dont say or do anything that isnt advised by ur future lawyer. and second, publicly, i dont exist in ur world / universe. make one mistake and u can get caught up in this for yrs and yrs and yrs.

my writing somewhere publicaly i was at m s k c c in 2025 is going to make ppl think, well right next door, thats prolly when they met.

i dont want to get obsessed with this bc its your thing, but fyi, your physical whereabouts, starting feb 2025 when i started at m s k c c could be under scrutiny, is there this could go for u, i dont think i should write it anywhere publicly even now bc it'll get cached until ur whole thing is done which could take years.

ahh so 2026 is going to be ww3 = penn lawsuit and then, ww4 = your stuff + brooklyn rumor mill of when we met and what we're doing ahhh total hard mode in life, so this is the calm before the storm, like the absolute hurricane of 2026. well when it comes to rumors now u know how to handle that: empirical evidence & timestamps.

ure an intelligent person, and ure a nice person, but u do dumb sht which is really, really interesting to me actually, dumber sht than ive ever done in my life. no one is going to give u any sympathy, in fact all of it will go to the other side ... so u do or say nothing and anything, absolutely nothing, without it being ok with ur future lawyer(s). everyone is going to turn on u, bc their number # 1 question will be when did i come in to the picture, they're going to want a timeline that they can prove to wring you out a towel.
